# Paper

Recent discussion by Preskill on Megaquop machines. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17368](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17368 "https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17368") The paper includes references to some recent hardware progress.

Holevo's theorem is sometimes called Holevo's bound, since it establishes an upper bound to the amount of information that can be known about a quantum state. It was published by Alexander Holevo an Russian scientist in 1973. Here is one of the publications from 1985 by American Mathematical Society. _**Review: A. S. Holevo, Probabilistic and statistical aspects of quantum theory 1985**_ [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38390623_Review_A_S_Holevo_Probabilistic_and_statistical_aspects_of_quantum_theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38390623_Review_A_S_Holevo_Probabilistic_and_statistical_aspects_of_quantum_theory "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38390623_Review_A_S_Holevo_Probabilistic_and_statistical_aspects_of_quantum_theory")

This is the original paper that David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa wrote in 1992 _**Rapid Solution of Problems by Quantum Computation**_ And this paper are the improvements that Richard Cleve, Artur Ekert, Chiara Macchiavello, and Michele Mosca added in 1998. _**Quantum Algorithms Revisited**_ [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9708016](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9708016 "https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9708016")

 _**A Temperature Change can Solve the Deutsch-Josza Problem : An Exploration of Thermodynamic Query Complexity by Jake Xuereb**_ [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15887](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15887 "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15887")

These are two original research papers from Ethan Bernstein and Umesh Vazirani on their algorithm. First is a preliminary abstract from 1993 and their finalized research from 1997. _**Quantum Complexity Theory - Preliminary Abstract 1993**_ [https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/167088.167097](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/167088.167097 "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/167088.167097") _**Quantum Complexity Theory 1997**_ [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/pubs/bv.pdf](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/pubs/bv.pdf "https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/pubs/bv.pdf")

Simon's Algorithm and here is the original Daniel R. Simon research paper from 1994 _**On the power of quantum computation**_ [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2822536_On_the_Power_of_Quantum_Computation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2822536_On_the_Power_of_Quantum_Computation "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2822536_On_the_Power_of_Quantum_Computation") and an article from AWS with Daniel Simon _**Exploring Simon’s Algorithm with Daniel Simon**_ [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/simons-algorithm/](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/simons-algorithm/ "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/simons-algorithm/")
